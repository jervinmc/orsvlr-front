                The business owner's first idea was turn to their land to an apartment for the abs-cbn workers in the area. But then decided
                to transition to resorts instead and because of that the first couple of rooms are studio-type rooms. During the Pandemic the
                resorts are closed due to the rise of Covid19 outbreak and this time of need the resorts are allowed to invite frontliners in the resort
                especially those frontliners that are in need of a place to stay. On the new normal the resorts move on and continues
                it's services for the mass.
